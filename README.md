<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to design a 2D pong game, on the Arduino DUE. This game will be displayed on a 2.8‚Äù TFT LCD screen connected to the Arduino board. There will be two players associated with the game: the human player, and the computer (AI). The players have the ability to move left or right. The movement of the human player is determined by the embedded accelerometer of your Android phone, such that the data will be transmitted over to the Arduino via Bluetooth. Other components are also used to make the game more interactive, such as buttons (to move states) or the potentiometers (to adjust the settings of the game). All of these individual components will be analysed in detail later in this report. </p>
